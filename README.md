# Online shop
In this project I was tasked with creating a simple react aplication of an online store, provided with a simple API that let me fetch product data but not make actual purchases.




It contains:

- Home page
- Product page
- Contact page
- Checkout page
- Checkout success page


## Description

The online shop is designed to list a series of fictional products that you can then view and then simulates you adding it to your cart before checking out. It doesn't have any real shopping functionality.
